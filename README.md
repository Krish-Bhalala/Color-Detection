# Color Detection with OpenCV

A mini project to learn computer vision basics using OpenCV (Day 2/30 in learning computer vision fundamental) 

## Overview
This project demonstrates color detection in images and video streams using Python and OpenCV. It's designed as a learning tool for beginners exploring computer vision fundamentals.

## Features
- Detect colors in images and live video
- Convert between BGR and HSV color spaces
- Create binary masks for color isolation
- Visualize detected color regions

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
3. Run `main.py`

## Fundamental Theory

### Color Detection
Formal Definition: Color detection is the process of identifying and isolating specific colors within digital images or video streams using computer vision techniques and color space transformations.

Simple Explanation: Imagine you have a big box of colorful toys. Color detection is like asking a robot to find all the red toys in the box. The robot looks at each toy and decides if it's red or not.

### Color Spaces
Formal Definition: A color space is a specific organization of colors that allows for reproducible representations of color, typically using three or four color components.

Simple Explanation: Think of color spaces like different ways to mix paints. Just like you can mix red, blue, and yellow to make other colors, computers use different "recipes" (color spaces) to make all the colors you see on screen.

### HSV Color Space
Formal Definition: HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) is a cylindrical color space that represents colors using three components: hue (color type), saturation (color intensity), and value (brightness).

Simple Explanation: Imagine a color wheel. The color you choose is the "hue". How strong that color is is the "saturation". And how bright or dark it is is the "value". It's like describing an ice cream: flavor (hue), how much flavor (saturation), and how much ice cream (value).

## Learning Objectives
- Understand color spaces (BGR, HSV)
- Implement basic image processing techniques
- Gain hands-on experience with OpenCV

## Next Steps
Experiment with different color ranges and apply to various images to deepen your understanding.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
